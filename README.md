# DataAnalyticsV3_Dashboard_Project
 Market analysis project for Data Analytics V3 MBA

## Exploratory dashboard
This project is aimed at building an interactive Dashboard which the user can use to navigate different market-related data, visualize it, compare it, and identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies. The end goal is for the user to be able to make accurate predictions beyond the usual technical analysis and indicators, focusing instead on the fundamentals, and outside influences.
## STEPS
* Suffered.
* Established dashboard's objective.
* Downloaded the relevant datasets.
* Fixed several formatting and compability issues (mostly caused by the sources' regional formats).
* Created 3 main sheets for each data-type, in order to properly classify and analyze the data.
* Used graphs and correlation coefficients to identify potential outliers, correlations, and possible causalities. 
* Created an interactive Dashboard with the most relevant information derived from the previous analysis, both to display it, and to facilitate further analysis.

## CONCLUSIONS
Beyond the traditional, already well stablished direct relations amongst the major indexes (NDX, S&P500, and DJI), I have identified the following:
* Prime Rate Loan and DGS10: Correlation, worth studying it further.
* DJI and BRENT_Futures: Strong correlation with some areas of conflict.
* EURUSD and DGS10: Correlation, worth further study due to the seemingly unrelated nature of those 2 indicators.
* CPI and major Indexes: Very strong correlation since 2017.


Recent conflicts and outside factors have caused sharp movements in the market, which, even though should be accounted for and considered outliers, cannot be ignored. Further analysis might be required in order to factor in external influences. 
The 2016-2020 period shows signs of market protectionism and manipulation, which can be explained by the 2018-2020 trade war between the US and China, ME issues, and political unrest.

## NEXT STEPS
* Adding a list of major geopolitical, mineral, and energy related conflicts, discoveries, news, and any relevant historical data.
* Explore potential impact of the previously mentioned information in market movements.
* Establish correlation between the previously mentioned information, market movements, and major economic indicators.

## CLOSING NOTES
Conclusions aside, I have succesfully achieved what I wanted: a visual, user-friendly DASHBOARD with which to easily navigate market related data.
